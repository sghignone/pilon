# PILON
## PILON: Automatically improve draft assemblies and find variation among strains

The current build is based on the bioconda distribution (v.1.23).

Several evidences (e.g. https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler/issues/147; https://github.com/broadinstitute/pilon/issues/26) show that the regular java release () could not be suited for large genomes/files, due to a memory issue.
